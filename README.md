## Project Overview

This project leverages the **Streamlit** framework to build an easy-to-use interface and **Hugging Face's Transformers** library to perform sentiment analysis using a pre-trained multilingual BERT-based model. The sentiment is classified into three categories: **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** based on the input text.
